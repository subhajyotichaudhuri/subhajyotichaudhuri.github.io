<b>About Me</b><br>
I am an <a href="https://www.iinano.org">International Institute for Nanotechnology Postdoctoral Fellow</a> working with <a href="https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/profiles/george-schatz.html">George Schatz</a> in the Department of Chemistry at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a>. Before this, I got my PhD with <a href="https://chem.yale.edu/faculty/victor-batista">Victor Batista</a> in the Department of Chemistry and the School of Engineering and Applied Science at <a href="https://www.yale.edu">Yale University</a>.
</p>
    
<p>
<b>Research</b><br>
I develop methods (utilizing electronic structure theory, statistical physics, stochastic methods, graph algorithms, and machine learning) to study charge, spin, and energy transfer in complex and disordered systems. Thanks to recent developments in machine learning and molecular dynamics, studying nuclear properties (structure-function correlations) in complex systems has become feasible - I want to do the same, but for electronic properties.    
</p>
    
<p>
<b>Research Philosophy</b><br>
I would rather get the wrong answer but understand why than get the right answer and not understand why.
</p>

<p>
<b>Physics-Informed Machine Learning</b><br>
I always try to find analytical solutions to my problems, which, sometimes, even for well-posed problems with closed-form expressions is impossible. In such cases, I try to solve the problem using numerical methods, which becomes intractable quite frequently as well. Often I end up coupling various types of machine-learning/statistical methods for classification, clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction with the laws of physics (that I expect my system to obey) to solve challenging problems.
I am particularly interested in <br>
- <i>how</i> and <i>what</i> is the 'machine' learning <br>
- how good are machine learning models at predicting emergent properties
</p>
    
<p>
<b>Sustainability</b><br>
I am ultimately interested in is inverse/rational design of chemical systems that will allow us to move closer to a sustainable future. My research has applications in problems ranging from renewable energy to electronic waste management.
