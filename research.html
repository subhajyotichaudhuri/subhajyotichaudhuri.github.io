Modern technologies heavily rely on materials with specific electrical, thermal, and magnetic properties. Charge, spin, and energy transfer processes are fundamental to many natural phenomena, including photosynthesis, respiration, and enzymatic reactions, as well as technological applications such as photovoltaics, batteries, and sensors. Understanding these processes in complex systems is crucial for advancing these fields.
<br>
<br>
In my research, I try to stay system-agnostic and develop generalized frameworks that allow us to study these fundamental processes. Quantum and semi-classical dynamics methods are accurate but cannot be used as effectively in complex systems where reaction coordinates are not easily identifiable. Fermi's Golden Rule-based methods are fast but approximate. I try to develop methods that have the best of both worlds. My research will allow us to create a scalable method that will allow us to study chemical properties that emerge from charge, spin, and energy transfer in complex and disordered systems.
<br>
<br>
This will open a completely new search space to then use machine learning tools and inverse-design materials for desired electronic properties (from disordered materials for surface catalysis to tailored proteins bioelectronics).
<br>
<br>
I find the theoretical (and computational) approach to science intellectually stimulating, but my research at the end of the day is problem-driven. I am passionate about building a sustainable future. I work in close collaborations with leading experimental groups across the globe in trying to solve some of the most challenging problems in the sustainability space - ranging from the design of chemical reactions for sustainable electronic waste recycling to understanding what type of self-assembled monolayer can increase perovskite solar cell performance. If you are interested in collaborating or discussing science, my (Northwestern) office has an open-door policy (or send me an email).

<b style="font-size: 1em;">Note:</b> I am in the tenure-track faculty job market in the 2024-25 academic year. If your (science/engineering) department is looking for a theorist, and you think I will be a good fit, please reach out! I have a research program designed on <b>physics-informed machine learning methods to design functional materials for a sustainable future</b>.
